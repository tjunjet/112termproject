# Introduction

Geometronome Dash is an adaptation of “Geometry Dash”, along with some additional features. Geometronome Dash works very similarly to Geometry Dash, in that you have a square that clears obstacles according to the rhythm of the music. Geometronome Dash aims to recreate that while still allowing the player to input any music file they like. After which, the game will use a beat-detection, pitch-detection, and smart map generation algorithm to generate the obstacles according to the rhythm and intensity of the music. The frequency of obstacle generation will utilize beat-detection algorithms while the complexity of the map will depend on the loudness and pitch of the music at that particular point of the music.
